# math-game
A little math game I made, to explore the use of localStorage.

##To Do
- [ ] optimize for mobile
- [ ] make different levels
- [ ] pause game option (probably new math problem when unpaused, to avoid cheating)
- [ ] restart/new game option
- [ ] implement localStorage
- [ ] implement stats (highest score, longest streak of practice days, etc.)
- [ ] other games? daily challenge ( randomly change the amount of time that people get to solve problem, not dependant on difficulty)?
- [ ] make speed/amount of time change as levels go up?
